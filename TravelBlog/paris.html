        <p>Paris, the capital of France, is known for its iconic Eiffel Tower, charming streets, rich history, and world-class cuisine. Visit the Louvre Museum, Notre-Dame Cathedral, and enjoy a cruise on the Seine River.Paris (French pronunciation: [paʁi] ⓘ) is the capital and largest city of France. With an estimated population of 2,048,472 residents in January 2025[3] in an area of more than 105 km2 (41 sq mi),[4] Paris is the fourth-most populous city in the European Union, the ninth-most populous city in Europe and the 30th most densely populated city in the world in 2022.[5] Since the 17th century, Paris has been one of the world's major centres of finance, diplomacy, commerce, culture, fashion, and gastronomy. Because of its leading role in the arts and sciences and its early adaptation of extensive street lighting, it became known as the City of Light in the 19th century.[6]

            The City of Paris is the centre of the Île-de-France region, or Paris Region, with an official estimated population of 12,271,794 inhabitants in January 2023, or about 19% of the population of France.[3] The Paris Region had a nominal GDP of €765 billion (US$1.064 trillion when adjusted for PPP)[7] in 2021, the highest in the European Union.[8] According to the Economist Intelligence Unit Worldwide Cost of Living Survey, in 2022, Paris was the city with the ninth-highest cost of living in the world.[9]
            
            Paris is a major railway, highway, and air-transport hub served by two international airports: Charles de Gaulle Airport, the third-busiest airport in Europe, and Orly Airport.[10][11] Opened in 1900, the city's subway system, the Paris Métro, serves 5.23 million passengers daily.[12] It is the second-busiest metro system in Europe after the Moscow Metro. Gare du Nord is the 24th-busiest railway station in the world and the busiest outside Japan, with 262 million passengers in 2015.[13] Paris has one of the most sustainable transportation systems[14] and is one of only two cities in the world that received the Sustainable Transport Award twice.[15]
            
            Paris is known for its museums and architectural landmarks: the Louvre received 8.9 million visitors in 2023, on track for keeping its position as the most-visited art museum in the world.[16] The Musée d'Orsay, Musée Marmottan Monet and Musée de l'Orangerie are noted for their collections of French Impressionist art. The Pompidou Centre, Musée National d'Art Moderne, Musée Rodin and Musée Picasso are noted for their collections of modern and contemporary art. The historical district along the Seine in the city centre has been classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1991.[17]</p>
